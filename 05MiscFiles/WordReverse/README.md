## PowerShell Word Reverse

This file takes a word entered by the user and reverses it, and it was written as a demonstration of string manipulation with PowerShell.

There are two methods used to reverse the input string. The first is to loop through the characters and store that in a new string. The second method converts the string to an array and use the .NET System.Array methods to reverse the string.
