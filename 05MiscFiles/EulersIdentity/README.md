## Euler's Identity with PowerShell

This file uses PowerShell to verify Euler's Identity (shown below) which is often considered one of the most beautiful mathematical equations. Since PowerShell doesn't have the ability to handle complex/imaginary numbers as a built in data type, .NET classes are used in the calculation.<br>
