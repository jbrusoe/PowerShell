## Connect to SQL Server with PowerShell

This file is a demonstration of how to connect and query data in a Microsoft SQL Server. The data that I used for it (contained in the C02.csv file) was taken from - https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/. This is a file I used when I teach PowerShell courses and not something that was used in a production environment which is why the password isn't the best one to use.
